# GrainFS CLI - Implementation Summary

## Overview

I have successfully created a simple shell CLI for the GrainFS encrypted filesystem library that demonstrates the ability to debug and navigate an encrypted grain FS. The CLI provides an interactive shell interface that allows users to explore encrypted filesystems transparently while also providing debugging capabilities to view the raw encrypted structure.

## What Was Built

### 1. Interactive Shell CLI (`cmd/grainfs-cli/main.go`)

A comprehensive command-line interface with the following features:

#### Navigation Commands
- `ls, list [path]` - List files and directories
- `cd <path>` - Change current directory
- `pwd` - Print working directory
- `tree [path]` - Display directory structure as a tree

#### File Operations
- `cat, read <file>` - Read and display file contents (decrypted)
- `write <file> <text>` - Write text to file (encrypted)
- `mkdir <path>` - Create directories
- `rm, remove <file>` - Remove files
- `stat <file>` - Show file information

#### Debug Commands
- `debug [path]` - Show debug information about the filesystem
- `raw [path]` - Show raw encrypted filesystem structure
- `filemap [path]` - Show filename mapping information

#### General Commands
- `help, h` - Show help message
- `exit, quit, q` - Exit the CLI

### 2. Key Features Demonstrated

#### Transparent Encryption/Decryption
- Files are automatically encrypted when written and decrypted when read
- Users interact with original filenames, not obfuscated ones
- All operations work seamlessly through the GrainFS layer

#### Filename Obfuscation
- Directory and file names are obfuscated on disk
- The CLI shows original names to users
- Raw view reveals the encrypted structure

#### Dual View Capability
- **User View**: Shows decrypted content and original filenames
- **Raw View**: Shows encrypted files and obfuscated filenames on disk
- Perfect for debugging and understanding the encryption process

#### Standard Shell Navigation
- Familiar commands like `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `cat`
- Path resolution with support for `.` and `..`
- Tree view for hierarchical directory visualization

### 3. Supporting Files

#### Build Configuration (`cmd/grainfs-cli/go.mod`)
- Proper Go module setup with dependencies
- Local replacement for the GrainFS library
- All required dependencies included

#### Documentation (`cmd/grainfs-cli/README.md`)
- Comprehensive usage instructions
- Example session walkthrough
- Command reference guide
- Installation and setup instructions

#### Demo Script (`cmd/grainfs-cli/demo.sh`)
- Automated demonstration of CLI capabilities
- Creates test data and shows various features
- Compares encrypted vs decrypted views

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **CLI Structure**: Clean separation of concerns with individual functions for each command
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Path Resolution**: Robust path handling supporting relative and absolute paths
- **Interactive Loop**: Standard REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) pattern

### Integration with GrainFS
- Uses the GrainFS library as intended through the billy.Filesystem interface
- Maintains access to underlying filesystem for raw view debugging
- Proper initialization with password-based encryption

### Key Code Components
1. **CLI struct**: Maintains state (current path, filesystem instances)
2. **Command dispatcher**: Routes commands to appropriate handlers
3. **Path resolver**: Handles relative path navigation
4. **Raw filesystem viewer**: Shows encrypted structure for debugging

## Usage Examples

### Basic Navigation
```bash
./grainfs-cli /path/to/encrypted/storage password123
grainfs:.> ls
grainfs:.> cd documents
grainfs:documents> cat secret.txt
```

### Debug Capabilities
```bash
grainfs:.> raw              # Show encrypted filenames
grainfs:.> debug            # Show debug information
grainfs:.> tree             # Show directory structure
```

### File Operations
```bash
grainfs:.> write test.txt Hello World
grainfs:.> mkdir new-folder
grainfs:.> rm old-file.txt
```

## Demonstration of Encryption

The CLI effectively demonstrates:

1. **File Content Encryption**: 
   - Write "Hello World" → stored as encrypted binary data
   - Read shows "Hello World" → transparently decrypted

2. **Filename Obfuscation**:
   - Create "secret.txt" → stored as "dUR0dVYon3ojezGE0tsxky8LB3ikls-ZrGtPCeUJJe74EIve_tUKxp_dcIPAyCNn7MCdWMuwWGsF-w=="
   - CLI shows "secret.txt" → user sees original name

3. **Directory Structure**:
   - Create "documents/private" → stored as obfuscated directory names
   - Navigation works with original names

## Testing and Validation

The CLI has been tested with:
- ✅ File creation and reading
- ✅ Directory creation and navigation
- ✅ Raw filesystem viewing
- ✅ Tree structure display
- ✅ Error handling for invalid operations
- ✅ Integration with existing GrainFS demo data

## Build and Installation

```bash
cd cmd/grainfs-cli
go build -o grainfs-cli
./grainfs-cli <storage-path> [password]
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Educational**: Clearly shows how encryption works at the filesystem level
2. **Debugging**: Allows developers to inspect both encrypted and decrypted views
3. **User-Friendly**: Familiar shell interface for easy adoption
4. **Comprehensive**: Covers all major filesystem operations
5. **Demonstrative**: Perfect for showcasing GrainFS capabilities

## Conclusion

The GrainFS CLI successfully fulfills the requirement to create a simple shell CLI that demonstrates the ability to debug and navigate an encrypted grain FS. It provides both practical functionality for working with encrypted filesystems and educational value for understanding how the encryption and obfuscation work under the hood.

The implementation showcases the power and transparency of the GrainFS library while providing essential debugging capabilities that would be valuable for developers working with encrypted filesystems.
